/* Pre-draft trade valuation. Pure math -- no DOM, no network -- so the node
   fixture can require it. Spec:
   docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-trade-calculator-design.md

   THE MODEL. A trade is a different draft. A team's pre-draft state is the
   roster it holds and the picks it holds; its value is the best starting
   lineup it could still finish from there, which is exactly
   Optimizer.finishRoster -> Optimizer.lineupPoints. Everything else falls out.

   TWO ASSET CLASSES, PLAYERS AND PICKS. A keeper is NOT a tradeable thing.
   Pre-draft a player is just a player; keeper designation happens afterwards
   and whoever owns him then sets their own keepers. So keeper status is
   DERIVED from the roster on both sides of every trade, never moved as an
   asset. Two consequences the whole valuation turns on:
     - an acquired player COMPETES for a keeper slot, he does not add one;
     - a keeper-ineligible player (cost <= R2) is worth exactly ZERO pre-draft,
       because he returns to the draft pool for everybody. Last year's first-
       and second-round picks are therefore not tradeable assets at all.

   WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. No additive "trade value chart". Additive
   asset value prices a fifth running back at full freight when he cannot
   start; that defect has been removed from this codebase twice already (v1's
   VORP scoring, and waitCost before 48795d2). It survives here only as a
   search heuristic inside the suggester and never reaches a displayed
   verdict. */

  // Which of this season's picks are left after the keepers are paid for.
  //
  // A keeper is paid for with a pick the team ACTUALLY HOLDS, and each keeper
  // consumes exactly one. Three things go wrong the moment that is relaxed
  // into "a set of cost rounds", and all three are the same error:
  //
  //   - Two keepers can compute to the SAME cost round -- two waiver pickups
  //     are both R12, and multi-year ladders converge as they walk down one
  //     round a year -- and a team holds one pick per round, so pricing both
  //     against it handed the team a free extra selection. Measured at 40.8
  //     points of phantom draft capital for a colliding pair.
  //   - A round the team traded away charged nothing, so trading away the very
  //     pick your keeper costs came out free.
  //   - A team holding two of the same round (Sleeper allows it; a traded pick
  //     keeps its original round) lost both to one keeper.
  //
  // Every number this tool displays is a difference of two state values, so a
  // keeper that is free on one side of a trade and not the other reads as pure
  // gain -- and the suggester will hunt for exactly that. Hence: real picks.
  //
  // Most expensive keeper first -- the LOWEST round number, the one giving up
  // the earliest pick -- each taking the LATEST held pick at or before his
  // cost. Downward is this league's actual rule, confirmed by the commissioner:
  // two keepers that both decay to R5 cost R5 and R4, not R5 and R6. It is also
  // the dearer of the two readings, worth 20.4 points on an early collision,
  // and it is the safe one to be wrong about -- upward would quietly discount
  // every pair of keepers that happens to land on the same round, and the
  // suggester would learn to stack them there.
  //
  // The result depends only on the multiset of costs, not on the order
  // recommendKeepers returned them in, because the function sorts its own
  // input. If the ladder has run below every pick the team holds he takes the
  // cheapest one instead: a keeper the team can barely pay for must never come
  // out cheaper than one it can pay for comfortably. A team holding no picks at
  // all is charged nothing -- there is nothing left to charge.
